**Research**

Each sport is unique based on how its played. Each position in the sport is also unique to its purpose in the play which affects how the individual should train. Sport-specific workouts help improve a players performance by training exact movements and skills that position. Exercises such as lateral shuffles help with defensive movements, jump squats build leg power for vertical jumps necessary for sports like basketball or volleyball, or cone drills that improve speed crucial for football players. These exercises prevent injuries by focusing on strengthening the exact muscles used in the sport. They also improve performance by increasing endurance in the skills they need most. Sport-specific workouts build confidence and prepare athletes mentally for the intensity and competition of the sport by mimikcing game day conditions.
  
Each sport has multiple types of players that contribute to different areas of the game. Due to this, they also require different training styles to perform in their specific position that they play. For example in football, wingers have lots of sprinting, high-speed runs, and need the ability to repeat sprint-run. On the other hand, midfielders focus on aerobic endurance, and constant movement. So, the training for each of these players would be different based on what they need to focus on.
  
Along with training and playing sports come injuries. Common injuries are sprains, joint injuries, muscle injuries, dislocations, fractures, achilles tendon injuries, and shin injuries. To prevent such injuries it is beneficial to create a balanced fitness plan that includes cardiovascular exercises, flexibility, and strength training. Along with exercising warm-ups and cooldowns help get muscles ready for a workout and also relaxed after to prevent strains. Diet and hydration also play a role into successful training with minimal injuries. 
  
AI based solutions in sports can optimize training, provide tactical advice, and minimize the risk of injury. AI based devices such as GPS vests, bands, and sensors can track heart rate, speed, distance, and movement patterns in which coaches cannot do. This helps the athlete track their progress which is important to improve performance levels. AI models can also analyze injury history, player workload, and game intensity. This hepls the athlete adjust their training intensity, and create recovery plans.
